 Material number 19 (used by element 11) should normally have at least   
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.

 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 11).

 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
